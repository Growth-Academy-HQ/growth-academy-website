    challenge: "In 2008, Dropbox faced three critical challenges in a nascent cloud storage market:\n\n" +
      "- Traditional advertising was yielding a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of $233-388 per user, while their product was priced at $99\n" +
      "- The concept of cloud storage was still unfamiliar to most users, requiring significant educational marketing\n" +
      "- Google Drive was rumored to be entering the market, threatening to outspend them in traditional marketing channels\n\n" +
      "As confirmed by Drew Houston, Dropbox's CEO, in his Y Combinator startup school presentation: \"We found that our initial cost per acquisition was more than twice our lifetime value per customer. We needed a completely different approach.\"",
    solution: "Dropbox implemented a two-sided referral program with several innovative features:\n\n" +
      "- Both referrer and referee received 500MB of bonus space (later increased to 1GB)\n" +
      "- Simple one-click sharing mechanism integrated directly into the product\n" +
      "- Progress bar showing users how close they were to earning more storage\n" +
      "- Multiple sharing options: email, social media, and direct links\n" +
      "- Double-sided incentive ensuring both parties benefited equally\n\n" +
      "According to Sean Ellis, who led Dropbox's early growth: \"The key was making the reward valuable enough to motivate sharing while ensuring it aligned with the product's core value proposition.\"",
