      results: [
        "Increased sign-ups by 60%",
        "Achieved 3900% growth in 15 months, growing from 100,000 users to 4 million",

      solution: "LinkedIn implemented a contact import feature, allowing users to easily invite their existing contacts from email to connect on LinkedIn. This helped build initial momentum, as new users could immediately connect with people they knew.",
      results: [
        "LinkedIn's user base grew significantly in its early years, largely due to the network effects created by the contact import feature",
